# Study of Correlations and Fluctuations in Particle Production Using Strongly-Intensive Quantities

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **correlations and fluctuations** in particle production during **ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions** using **strongly-intensive quantities Σ and ∆**. These observables provide crucial insights into the early stages of nuclear-nucleus collisions, where **Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)**, a new state of matter, is created under controlled laboratory conditions at **ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment)** at the **LHC**.

The project specifically studies **asymmetric proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at 5.02 TeV**, aiming to measure forward-backward correlations and compare the results to those from **Pb-Pb** and **pp collisions**. By analyzing these correlations, we gain valuable information on particle production mechanisms and the possible phase transitions of nuclear matter.

## Project Aim

The project aims to:
- Measure **forward-backward multiplicity correlations** using the strongly-intensive quantities **Σ** and **∆** in asymmetric **p-Pb collisions** at **5.02 TeV**.
- Compare the measured results to those obtained from **Pb-Pb** and **pp collision data**.
- (Optional) Investigate the extraction of **fragmentation functions** using the **Wounded Constituent Model**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into three main folders, but the primary focus is the `Project` folder. Here's a brief overview of each folder:

- `Paperwork`: Contains personal documents related to my studies in Europe. You can skip this folder, as it is unrelated to the technical aspects of the research.
  
- `Project`: This is the core folder where all the technical work, data, and code related to this research project can be found. This is where you should focus to follow the analysis and outcomes.

- `dohuyenanh_tssp`: Contains application materials for another internship I applied for during the same period, which was unsuccessful. I’ve kept this folder to remind myself and readers that rejections are learning experiences.

### Contents of the Project Folder

The `Project` folder contains several key subfolders and files that are critical to understanding the research and analysis process:

#### **.csv Files (Output Data)**
In the root of the `Project` folder, you’ll find several `.csv` files. These files contain the **output data** generated by the analysis algorithms located in the `.C` files within the `No_Pile_Up_Data` and `Big_Data_Package` directories. The `.csv` files represent the key results of our analysis and are essential for further processing and visualization.

#### **.pdf Files (Comparison Plots)**
Also located in the root of the **Project** folder, the `.pdf` files contain **plots** generated from the data in the `.csv` files `.py` files. Each PDF includes multiple plots within the same category, allowing readers to easily compare results across different datasets or analysis conditions. For a comprehensive overview, it is **highly recommended** to refer to these **PDF plots** rather than the individual plots in the `individual_plots` folder. The PDF format enables easier comparison of results in a single file.

#### **Subfolders in Project:**

- `Presentation`: Contains images used in the final presentation for this project. These visuals highlight key findings and analysis results presented during the project’s conclusion.

- `Materials`: This folder contains previous presentation slides from my supervisor, which I used as reference material while preparing my own presentation. Though not directly part of the analysis, these materials provide context for how results can be effectively communicated.

- `individual_plots`: Contains each individual plot generated during the analysis. This folder was mainly used for organizing plots during the presentation preparation phase. However, for easier comparison and more comprehensive visualizations, it is better to refer to the **.pdf** files in the root of the **Project** folder.

**Note**: These 3 folders mentioned above is not necessary to read

- `Small_Data_Package`: Contains our initial analysis on a small dataset. This folder includes early code and tests, which allowed us to verify our methods before applying them to a larger dataset.

- `Big_Data_Package`: After refining our analysis, this folder contains the optimized code applied to a full-sized dataset. Improvements in the algorithm made the execution time similar to that of the small dataset, despite the larger size.

- `No_Pile_Up_Data`: Includes a variation of the experiment with more detailed output data, where we applied the same analysis as in previous runs but added an additional cut to account for the new information.

**Note**: You can find the `.root` files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PQ0XCErFxp85-98umAgFFRRvcrNrFVVK?usp=sharing), they are the data that will be processed by our `.C` algorithm in the **ROOT** framework.
